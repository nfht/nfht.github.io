I'm a Senior Lecturer in the Astrophysical e-Science Laboratory of the 
School of Computing, Engineering and Mathematics, Western Sydney University.
My research interests are in observational astronomy and astrophysics,
covering a wide range of distances, wavelengths and techniques:

Astrophysics of the Galactic Interstellar Medium in gamma rays and cm-wave to terahertz radio astronomy;

optical and radio-interferometric surveys of the distant universe;

Antarctic astronomy;

and new techniques in radio and optical imaging.

I used to work in Antarctica; I ran AST/RO - a submillimetre-wave telescope at
Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station - for a year,including a winterover.
I've also been involved in plans and projects to exploit other possible
observatory sites on the Ice: Dome A and Dome C.
